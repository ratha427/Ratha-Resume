<h2>Projects </h2>
<p>Online Food Delivery Web Application (Mini Project)<hr/>
  
    Developed a full-stack web application enabling users to browse restaurants, view menus, place orders, and make 
    secure online payments. Implemented responsive UI with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js for seamless user experience.
     Built backend services using Node.js and Express.js, integrated with SQL/MongoDB for order and user management. Added 
     features like real-time order tracking, authentication, and cart management. Deployed application on cloud platform 
     with version control using Git/GitHub</p>

<p>Obstacle Avoiding Vehicle (Mini Project)<hr/>
    I designed and built a small autonomous vehicle using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors.  
The car was able to detect obstacles in front of it and automatically change direction to avoid them.  
I wrote the basic motor control code and distance detection logic to make the movement smooth.  
This project gave me hands-on experience with hardware, coding, and real-time problem solving.</p>
